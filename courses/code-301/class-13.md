- the HTTP methods incorporated by a web REST API use the CRUD functions with different names

### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

referenced these steps on restfulapi.net [https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/]

1. identify the resources
   a. use an object model

2. create model URIs
   a. based on resource idenfication in previous step
   b. URIs should be nouns only

3. determine resource representations
   a. variety of resource representations

4. assign HTTP methods
   a. map the application's possible operations to the predetermined resource URIs

5. perform other actions
   a. logging
   b. security/authentication
   c. discovery
