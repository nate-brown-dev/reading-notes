## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?

- he was an early web developer
- the HTTP protocol is named after him

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- the techniques in this class only function on a certain type of computers

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- HTTP is the hypertext transport protocol
- it's how web pages link to one another

### What does a GET do?

- a GET is a request for resources
- when a browser GETs something, it's requesting the human readable version

### What does a POST do?

- POST is used by one system to add something to another system

### What does PUT do?

- PUT is used by one system to replace something in another system

### What does PATCH do?

- PATCH is used for partial updates (instead of PUT for complete replacement)
