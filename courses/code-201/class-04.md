# Code 201 Reading 4

## HTML

### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- `<a>` element
- (a = "anchor")

### The href attribute contains what information?

- `<a href="link.html">`
- (href = "hypertext reference")

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- make sure not to put any information in the link title that isn't accessible somewhere else
- anything in the link title can only be seen by hovering with a mouse and won't work with keyboard, touch screen

## CSS

### What is meant by “normal flow”?

- "normal flow" is the default CSS page layout

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

- block elements take up full width of parent element
- sequential block elements are displayed in the "block flow direction" normally top to bottom
- inline elements take the width of their content
- inline elements don't break to new lines unless there are enough to overfill the width of parent element
- when this happens any that don't fit go to next line in block flow direction

### ___ positioning is the default for every html element

`static` positioning

### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

- absolute positioned elements have their own layer and don't affect position of any other elements
- can overlay page for UI, popups etc
- can be overlaid on each other using z-index

### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

- fixed remain in same plage when page scrolls (tool bar, etc)
- absolute always stay in same place on page

## JS

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- function declaration includes the function code, but doesn't do anything until called
- function invocation doesn't have any code, only passes input to the code in the function declaration

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- there isn't any difference according to Mozilla
- parameter === argument

## Misc

### 2 benefits of pair programming

- Social skills
  - Not necessarily "how to make friends" social skills but more like "how to talk about code" skills
  - I find it very helpful to talk through work with someone else.
  - even if I think I know what I'm doing, talking about it will either prove me right, or make me realize I'm screwed up

- Job interview readiness
  - related to above, being able to talk about code intelligently, and explain code to interviewers/employers in a way that they understand
  - being able to explain OTHER PEOPLES code, not just your own, and realize whats going on
