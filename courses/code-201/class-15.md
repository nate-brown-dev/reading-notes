# Code 201 Readings: Psychological Safety

## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- positive/beneficial group norms
  - members of the group are mutually supportive of one another
  - group members don't try to talk over each other or compete for status on the team
  - this doesn't mean that the groups don't always have recognized leaders, but it does imply that when the group has such a leader, the other members of the group follow the leader and don't undermine them or jockey for position by appealing outside the group

- sharing conversational time
  - "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
  - this means that each member of the team is able to speak as much as they need to, not necessarily in a single meeting or event, but throughout the course of a work day or many work days

- high average social sensitivity
  - overall the members of the team are sensitive to one another's feelings and are able to recognize and interpret non-verbal and other cues, and respond accordingly

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety

- when I was deployed to Poland from 2021-22, the group of senior platoon leadership that I was part of was a place with outstanding psychological safety. We had a defined leader (the lieutenant) but everyone in the group worked to support him and support the other members of the group
- our meetings would always start with 10 minutes of random discussion, jokes, making coffee, etc. when we finished up these things we would get to business.
- nobody tried to rush the meetings, or interject out of turn, or seriously argue. When we did have disagreements they were always sorted out in a way that left everyone feeling better about things.
- when we had to do things that nobody wanted to do, it was mutually understood that we would do them in a certain order so that no one person had to do them over and over again.

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- good teams increase productivity, and therefore make good business/financial sense
- team members are more likely to have high job satisfaction, and be better individual performers
- in software, working in teams increases creativity and reduces mistakes by having multiple sets of eyes on a problem at the same time
- I've already experienced this in the partner exercises
- my group on the lab 14 code rewrite went very well because my partner and I were able to bounce ideas off each other as we were writing the code
