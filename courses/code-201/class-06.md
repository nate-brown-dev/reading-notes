# Code 201 Reading 6

## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

- an object is like a pocket calculator
- it can perform multiple operations and be re-used
- all of its functions are related
- the operations are called 'methods'
- the inputs are called 'properties'

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

- DRY
- create object as you write it instead of as function

### How do objects differ from arrays?

- object's properties can be called in a different/simpler way than array elements
- objects also include methods, arrays are only data sets

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

- if the object property name is held as a variable must use bracket notation

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

- "this" in the code refers to Spot (by name)

### What is the DOM?

- the document object model/DOM is a representation of a web page as "objects" and "nodes"

### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

- the DOM provides a way for javascript and other languages to interact with the page
- it is not written in a specific language
- it is an independent web API
