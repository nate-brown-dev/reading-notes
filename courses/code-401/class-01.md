# Code 401 Reading 1

## Reading: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

- Node is a framework that allows programs written in JavaScript to run outside of a web browser
- When JavaScript was invented it was intended to only be used in the browser
- Node thus extends JavaScript's capabilities outside of that use case

### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

- a "runtime" is a library for executing programs
- "a runtime implements the execution model, built-in functions, and other fundamental behaviors of a programming language" [thanks wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library)

### What is Node used for?

- Run programs on the server side
- Run entire servers with Express
- Run asynchronous code
- Allows large numbers of simultaneous connections because of single threading and async/await

## Additional Questions

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

- Thing I am most excited to work on is AWS/cloud deployment
- When I first started looking into coding/software as a career this was the thing that drew my attention
- I grew up in the 1980s with locally stored data on floppy disks
- I don't game, I don't follow social media, and I don't use desktop computers for anything besides work
- However I use cloud apps literally every day on my phone, they were life changing for me

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

- I want to practice writing tests with Jest
- Watching the test suites run in 301 for the code challenges and the final was intriguing
- Turns out they are not complicated at all under the surface

## Things I want to know more about

- Jest, AWS, azure/other cloud providers (might not get much coverage?)
