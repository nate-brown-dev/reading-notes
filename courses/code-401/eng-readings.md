# Engineering Readings

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I'm very willing to walk away from "opportunities" that involve time and/or money. I have the opposite problem of that guy who says most people don't value their time. I value my time more than anything else in the world. I don't watch TV or use social media or say yes to a bunch of things I don't want to do. My time isn't worth $1,000 per hour, it's priceless.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- break the problem into smaller pieces, assess which of these pieces is the easiest to solve, and solve it

- delete everything and start over, trying to use a different method to solve the problem (or maybe just comment it out)

- leave the problem and go do something totally unrelated for a while, like 2 hours or more. Go for a walk, run, lift etc
