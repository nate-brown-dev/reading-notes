# Notes on Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- You need to understand what the data is now, and what it might become later
- The type of data will determine what data structure to use

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- Have a base case that will cause the function to stop recursing
